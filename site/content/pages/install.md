Kubernetes operator for deploying eduk8s workshop environments on Kubernetes.

## Deploying the eduk8s operator

To deploy the operator, run:

```bash
kubectl apply -k "github.com/eduk8s/eduk8s-operator?ref=master"
```

Note that tagged versions haven't been created as yet, so this is using the latest version. Tagging of versions will be setup soon.

The command above will create a namespace in your Kubernetes cluster called `eduk8s` and the operator along with any required namespaced resources will be created in it. A set of custom resource definitions and a global cluster role binding will also be created. The list of resources you should see being created are:

```bash
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/workshopenvironments.training.eduk8s.io created
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/workshoprequests.training.eduk8s.io created
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/workshops.training.eduk8s.io created
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/workshopsessions.training.eduk8s.io created
serviceaccount/eduk8s created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/eduk8s-cluster-admin created
deployment.apps/eduk8s-operator created
```

You can check that the operator deployed okay by running:

```bash
kubectl get all -n eduk8s
```

The pod for the operator should be marked as running.

### Specifying the ingress domain

The operator when deploying instances of the workshop environments needs to be able to expose them via an external URL for access. To define the domain name that can be used as a suffix to hostnames for instances, you need to set the `INGRESS_DOMAIN` environment variable on the operator deployment. To do this run:

```bash
kubectl set env deployment/eduk8s-operator -n eduk8s INGRESS_DOMAIN=test
```

Replace `test` with the domain name for your Kubernetes cluster.

If you do not set this, the ingress created will use `training.eduk8s.io` as a default.

If your Kubernetes cluster doesn't have an ingress controller configured, you will need to use port forwarding to access a workshop environment.

## Deploying workshop environments

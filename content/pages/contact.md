We are a set of enthusiastic Cloud Native Developer Advocates working for an important company that like to teach people about Cloud Native technologies on the Kubernetes ecosystem.

The team is formed by:

* **Grant Shipley**: The Boss
* **Graham Dumpleton**: Grumpleton for his friends. Always complaining but doing most of the hard work.
* **Jorge Morales**: The catalyst. Doesn't like to work but makes sure people does the work.
* **Daniel Helfand**: Junior. He runs all the time, but when he's not running you can see him around Tekton.
* **Stephen Augustus**: The releaser. He releases everything at his hands. Even a tweet every 5 minutes.

If you would like to get in touch with us, just gives us a call.

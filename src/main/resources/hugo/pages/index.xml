      <description>We always thought that Kubernetes was difficult to grasp. We&amp;rsquo;ve been fighting for some years to bring some sense to the project, but since we don&amp;rsquo;t know the Go language, we dediced that it was better to show people how they could use the platform and tools in the ecosystem.
This is how eduk8s was born. We needed a platform that would allow us to teach people the usage of Kubernetes and the Cloud Native Foundation Landscape.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes operator for deploying eduk8s workshop environments on Kubernetes.
Deploying the eduk8s operator To deploy the operator, run:
kubectl apply -k &amp;#34;github.com/eduk8s/eduk8s-operator?ref=master&amp;#34; Note that tagged versions haven&amp;rsquo;t been created as yet, so this is using the latest version. Tagging of versions will be setup soon.
The command above will create a namespace in your Kubernetes cluster called eduk8s and the operator along with any required namespaced resources will be created in it.</description>
